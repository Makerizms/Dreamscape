Feel free to give me constructive feedback and suggestions on anything related to this game

Inspired by: 
  - Minecraft
  - Godot Engine
  - Garry's Mod
  - Resonite
  - Dreams (PS4)

Some possible base features:
  - Elements
    - Function kind of like folders and files, everything in the game is an element or a collection of elements called a compound element, whether it's a player, a world, a gun, a music file, a 3d model, etc.
  - Connections
    - Used to connect elements and make compound elements
    - There are different types of connections
    - Connections determine how the elements within a compound element interact with each other and result in functionality 
  - Game wide "inventory" system linked to your account
  - Search and discovery tools for finding assets, creations, players, etc.
  - Association system linking all of the public creations by creating a web of associations between different values of elements, for example if you have a gun you can then use the association system to search for other guns, bullets, attachments, or anything that is associated with guns conceptually
  - No HUD or menus user interface
  - Effortless and cross platform multiplayer

Some possible features:
  - Stress based destruction system
  - Voxels/Grid based building system
  - Polygon based asset creation and sculpting
  - Shader creation
  - 3d space based visual scripting language and logic that accounts for errors
  - Music and sound creation tools

Note: Everything here is a work in progress and subject to change
